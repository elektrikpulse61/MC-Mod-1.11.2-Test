# MC-Mod-1.11.2-Test
A test mod for Minecraft 1.11.2

Before doing anything with this, please note the following:
  1. This project doesn't actually work for me in the current state.
  2. I don't plan on developing this after I finish my YouTube tutorial.
  3. I'm only putting it on GitHub for the sake of backing it up to a cloud storage because I am lazy and don't feel like keeping an organized archive on my home computer.
  4. Do what you please with this... I couldn't care less considering it's from a YouTube tutorial.
  
Is this what a README is supposed to look like? What else should I put in here? 
I just wanted to put one in because everything has a README these days. And who wants to be left out?
